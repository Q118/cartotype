# Cartotype
## Prototype of a Shopping Cart


### Tools intentionally used for groking
1.	custom hooks
2.	context API, 
3.	advanced TypeScript, 
4.	reducing effect dependencies, 
5.	use reducer to extract state logic into
6.	querying a series of state updates (aka batch updates)


Aim is to keep components “pure” without overcomplicating modularization.
