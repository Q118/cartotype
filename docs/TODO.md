<!-- // a lot of logic will need to be made bc like it WAS expecting that json list and now i need to UPDATE THROUGHOUT to have it use the db! -->... 

- in admin and Store: make the loading appear until the photos are fully rendered SO THAT the user doesnt see those ugly blank squares.



<!--! Work on this next.. and start the linkedIn course yaaa -->
- Implement the Notes page using Kyles video as starting point
the notes are all about the different products and there will then be an option on each produc card; view any related notes for this product made by you [or others]


- add search, filtering and sorting, pagination for both admin and store...
    - like the scroll event triggers more querying

    
<!-- // TODO have a flash notification message thing at top corner to alert users of things happening but not blocking the ui 
// the items getting removed from cart
// added to cart?
// admin items added to store
// admin item updated
-->
<!-- // the final details part of form Steps:  -->
    <!-- // have that card be more of a thumbnail size AND  -->
    <!-- // HAVE that add button but disabled -->
    <!--// TODO add confirmation on last step that the user wants to add the item with those details, to the store -->
    <!-- // maybe do that with like a third step of the form and include the PreviewConfirm component -->


<!-- // - EditForm will list all the current items with a <Stack> and just thumbnail images.. -->
    <!-- // option to edit each param, or delete the item -->
<!-- // add all the credidatiopn needed -->
