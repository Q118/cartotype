<!-- // a lot of logic will need to be made bc like it WAS expecting that json list and now i need to UPDATE THROUGHOUT to have it use the db! -->... 

<!-- TODO: make the whpole app be agnostic.... like a total agnostic that could just be skeleton and any kind of data thats realted to eachother could e pluugged into it... or really just great skeleton to use for any starting point wiht a new React App -->

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<!-- first prob need to like have the notes go to database instead of local stopreage.. but really just using ids to relate so may be okay for now... -->
<!-- ! Work on this next.. and start the linkedIn course yaaa
? THEN.. start to hook it up to the rest of theapp.. connect to  the store items and shit and the admin stuff too 
*  the notes are all about the different products and there will then be an option on each produc card; view any related notes for this product made by you [or others] ... its like a portal...
    ? - cant use tags for store items.. tags are for searchign and shiz

! click on the note symbol on the storeItemCard => opens up notes view of all notes that relate to that store item... so using like routing for that in the url... also an addNote option from the storeItem itseldf?
? but if you hover over the symbol.. the popup holds the titles of all the notes related to it...

* maybe just something in the top right corner that says which shop itemS it belongs to

-->


- in admin and Store: make the loading appear until the photos are fully rendered SO THAT the user doesnt see those ugly blank squares.


- add search, filtering and sorting, pagination for both admin and store...
    - like the scroll event triggers more querying

    
<!-- // TODO have a flash notification message thing at top corner to alert users of things happening but not blocking the ui 
// the items getting removed from cart
// added to cart?
// admin items added to store
// admin item updated
-->
<!-- // the final details part of form Steps:  -->
    <!-- // have that card be more of a thumbnail size AND  -->
    <!-- // HAVE that add button but disabled -->
    <!--// TODO add confirmation on last step that the user wants to add the item with those details, to the store -->
    <!-- // maybe do that with like a third step of the form and include the PreviewConfirm component -->


<!-- // - EditForm will list all the current items with a <Stack> and just thumbnail images.. -->
    <!-- // option to edit each param, or delete the item -->
<!-- // add all the credidatiopn needed -->
