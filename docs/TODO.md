<!-- ! first:: fix whats happenign with the Actual shooping cart:: 1-its displaying more then what is in there and 2- getting itt to display teh new items from db in the sideCart -->

- make the loading appear until the photos are fully rendered SO THAT the user doesnt see those ugly blank squares.


- set up pagination in the store and/or lazy loading
    like the scroll event triggers more querying


- EditForm will list all the current items with a stack and just thumbnail images..
    - option to edit each param, or delete the item



- the final details part of form Steps: have that card be more of a thumbnail size AND OR HAVE that add button but disabled
