<!-- // a lot of logic will need to be made bc like it WAS expecting that json list and now i need to UPDATE THROUGHOUT to have it use the db! -->... 

- in admin and Store: make the loading appear until the photos are fully rendered SO THAT the user doesnt see those ugly blank squares.

- set up pagination in the store and/or lazy loading
    like the scroll event triggers more querying

- EditForm will list all the current items with a stack and just thumbnail images..
    - option to edit each param, or delete the item



- the final details part of form Steps: 
    - have that card be more of a thumbnail size AND 
    <!-- // HAVE that add button but disabled -->
    - add confirmation on last step that the user wants to add the item with those details, to the store
