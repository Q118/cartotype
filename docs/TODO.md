<!-- // a lot of logic will need to be made bc like it WAS expecting that json list and now i need to UPDATE THROUGHOUT to have it use the db! -->... 

- in admin and Store: make the loading appear until the photos are fully rendered SO THAT the user doesnt see those ugly blank squares.

- set up pagination in the store and/or lazy loading
    like the scroll event triggers more querying

<!--! Work on this next.. and start the linkedIn course yaaa -->
- EditForm will list all the current items with a <Stack> and just thumbnail images..
    - option to edit each param, or delete the item

<!-- // add all the credidatiopn needed -->
the notes are all about the different products and there will then be an option on each produc card; view any related notes for this product made by you [or others]

- the final details part of form Steps: 
    <!-- // have that card be more of a thumbnail size AND  -->
    <!-- // HAVE that add button but disabled -->
    <!-- TODO add confirmation on last step that the user wants to add the item with those details, to the store -->
